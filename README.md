# Venomous-Freemode

A freemode gamemode fully written from scratch. It's aiming for modularity by splitting parts of the gamemode into multiple independent resources.
This allows you to remove parts at your will, add custom extensions without conflicting resources and even use single parts outside of the gamemode.

Right now it only includes the formerly named NativePhone resource, which adds a phone to the game using scaleforms instead of NUI.

Any contributions are welcome!
